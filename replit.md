## System Architecture

### Backend
- **Framework**: Laravel 11.9 on PHP 8.3+ with Composer for dependency management.
- **Database**: MySQL/MariaDB with Laravel Eloquent ORM and Migrations.
- **Authentication**: Laravel Sanctum for API, Laravel UI for web, Multi-guard for admin/users, and Laravel Socialite for OAuth.
- **Task Management**: Cron job management and Laravel Queue for asynchronous processing.
- **Security**: CSRF protection, libphonenumber-for-php for phone validation, HTMLPurifier for XSS prevention, and API rate limiting.

### Frontend
- **Build Tool**: Vite for asset compilation.
- **UI Framework**: Bootstrap 5 for responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: jQuery 3.7.1 for DOM manipulation.
- **Styling**: Custom HSL-based CSS architecture with CSS custom properties for theming (light/dark mode support, modular color system).
- **Components**: Slick Carousel, WOW.js for animations, Flatpickr for date selection, iziToast for notifications, and a custom Markdown parser.

### Real-time & Messaging
- **Real-time**: Pusher for WebSocket communication and Laravel's broadcasting system.
- **Push Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) with service worker implementation.
- **WhatsApp Integration**:
    - **Meta WhatsApp Business API**: Official API for business messaging with synchronous message delivery.
    - **Baileys (@whiskeysockets/baileys)**: Node.js service for direct WhatsApp Web connection, QR code authentication, session management, and webhook handling with asynchronous job-based delivery.
    - **Unified Flow**: Both integrations utilize a common database schema and message processing logic. Each WhatsApp account uses exclusively one method (Meta API OR Baileys), and AI auto-replies are sent using the same method that received the incoming message.
    - **Message Status Tracking**: 
        - Baileys: Messages saved with `job_id` and Status::SCHEDULED, updated to Status::SENT via webhook when delivery confirms.
        - Meta API: Messages saved with `whatsapp_message_id` and Status::SENT immediately upon synchronous response.
    - **Media Support**: Handles various media types (text, images, documents, video, audio) with inline previews (images up to 25MB, videos up to 50MB with HTML5 player, audio up to 20MB with HTML5 player), download buttons, and real-time status updates.
    - **AI Assistant Integration**:
        - **3-Tier Fallback Detection**: Detects when AI doesn't know the answer via special keyword (FALLBACK_RESPONSE), common phrases (PT/EN like "n√£o sei", "i don't know"), or API failures.
        - **Configurable Auto-Reactivation**: When AI triggers fallback and human sends manual message, system can automatically reactivate AI responses either immediately or after a configurable delay (in minutes).
        - **Method Consistency**: AI responses are always sent using the same delivery method (Meta API or Baileys) that received the original message.

### File Processing
- **Image Manipulation**: Intervention Image.
- **Spreadsheet**: PhpSpreadsheet for Excel/CSV.
- **PDF Generation**: DomPDF from HTML templates.

### Admin Panel
- **Data Visualization**: ApexCharts.
- **Code Editor**: CodeMirror for syntax highlighting.
- **UI Enhancements**: Spectrum color picker, jQuery UI, Summernote WYSIWYG editor, and Select2 for enhanced dropdowns.

### Internationalization
- Multi-language support using JSON-based translation files and Laravel Localization.
